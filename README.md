# CAMPUSMATE – A College Companion
A centralized web platform designed to simplify academic communication between students, faculty, and administrators.
CampusMate eliminates fragmented communication channels like notice boards, WhatsApp groups, and scattered emails by providing a **single digital platform** for sharing notices, assignments, notes, timetables, and events.

## Problem Statement
In many colleges, academic information is distributed across multiple sources such as physical notice boards, emails, and messaging groups. This fragmented system leads to:
* Missed deadlines
* Confusion about schedules
* Difficulty in accessing important resources
CampusMate solves this by creating a **centralized digital system** that becomes the single source of academic information.

## Objectives
* Centralize academic resources in one platform
* Provide easy access to notices, notes, assignments, and timetables
* Reduce information overload and missed deadlines
* Simplify resource sharing for faculty
* Improve communication between students and faculty

## System Architecture
The application follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture**.
* **Model** → Database and business logic
* **View** → User interface built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
* **Controller** → Flask routes handling requests and responses
This architecture helps maintain clean and organized code.
